\usage{
TreeScan(
  data,
  exposure,
  p = FALSE,
  leafs,
  id,
  n_monte_carlo_sim = 9999,
  random_seed = FALSE,
  n_level = FALSE,
  future_control = list(strategy = "sequential")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset used for the computation. The dataset needs to include the
 following columns:
 \itemize{
   \item{An integer that is unique to every individual.}
   \item{A string identifying the unique diagnoses or leafs for each
              individual.}
   \item{A case indicator}
   }

   The dataset needs to be in long format, i.e., each individual has
   multiple rows depending of unique events that occurred to the
   individuals, e.g.

   ```
    id diag case
     1 K251    0
     2 Q702    0
     3  G96    0
     3 S949    0
     4 S951    0
     4 N882    0
     4 R610    0
     4  E67    0
   ```}

\item{exposure}{The name of the exposure variable in `data`.}

\item{p}{The proportion of exposed individuals in the dataset. The default is the
proportion of exposed individuals among unique individuals in `data`.}

\item{leafs}{The name of the leaf variable in `data`.}

\item{id}{The name of the id variable in `data`.}

\item{n_monte_carlo_sim}{The number of Monte-Carlo simulations to be used for calculating P-values.}

\item{random_seed}{Random seed used for the Monte-Carlo simulations.}

\item{n_level}{The maximum number of character that identify a unique cut. The default
is the maximum character length found in `leafs`.}

\item{future_control}{A list of arguments passed `future::plan`. This is useful if one would like
to parallelise the Monte-Carlo simulations to decrease the computation
time. The default is a sequential run of the Monte-Carlo simulations.}
